This is a travel-oriented iOS app built using **SwiftUI** and **MapKit** that allows users to search for locations, get directions with route lines, view estimated distance and time, and launch directions in Apple Maps.

##  Features

-  **MapKit Integration**: Real-time route drawing and user location tracking
-  **Multiple Travel Modes**: Supports driving, walking, and transit navigation
-  **ETA & Distance Display**: Clean info cards for route distance and estimated time
-  **Live Updates**: Map refreshes automatically when inputs or travel mode change

-  **Modern SwiftUI UI**: Responsive, minimal design using SwiftUI components
